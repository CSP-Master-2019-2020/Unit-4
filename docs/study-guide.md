# Unit 4: Study Guide

## You should be able to:

[**Lesson 1: What is Big Data?**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/1/):
* Identify sources of data produced, used, and consumed by a web application.
* Given a tool that provides access to a large dataset, explain the kinds of problems such a tool could solve.
* Use a tool that provides access to “big data” and investigate its sources.
* Explain that new techniques are necessary to store, manage, transmit, and process data at the scale it is currently being produced.
  - Remember Randall Munroe's (of XKCD fame) answer to the question [***Google's Datacenters on Punch Cards***](https://what-if.xkcd.com/63/) where he estimates the size of the "data warehouse" needed to hold the data Google is collecting if we still stored data on punch cards.
