# Unit 4: Study Guide

## You should be able to:

[**Lesson 1: What is Big Data?**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/1/):
* Identify sources of data produced, used, and consumed by a web application.
* Given a tool that provides access to a large dataset, explain the kinds of problems such a tool could solve.
* Use a tool that provides access to “big data” and investigate its sources.
* Explain that new techniques are necessary to store, manage, transmit, and process data at the scale it is currently being produced.
  - Remember Randall Munroe's (of XKCD fame) answer to the question [***Google's Datacenters on Punch Cards***](https://what-if.xkcd.com/63/) where he estimates the size of the "data warehouse" needed to hold the data Google is collecting if we still stored data on punch cards.

[**Lesson 2: Finding Trends with Visualizations**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/2/):
* Use [**Google Trends**](https://www.google.com/trends/) to identify and explore connections and patterns within a data visualization.
* Accurately describe what a data visualization of a trend is showing.
* Provide plausible explanations of trends and patterns observed within a data visualization.

[**Lesson 3: Check Your Assumptions**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/3/):
* Define the *digital divide* as the variation in access or use of technology by various demographic characteristics.
* Identify the assumptions made when drawing conclusions from data and data visualizations

[**Lesson 4: Rapid Research - Data Innovations**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/4/):
* Identify a suitable computing innovation for a research project.
* Identify reliable and authoritative sources of information about a computing innovation.
* Synthesize information taken from multiple online sources to create a cohesive description of a computing innovation.
* Explain how data drives a specific innovation, both in writing and visually.

[**Lesson 5: Identifying People With Data**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/5/):
* Explain privacy concerns that arise through the mass collection of data
* Use online search tools to find and connect information about a person or topic of interest.
* Explain how multiple sources of data can be combined in order to uncover new knowledge or information.
* Analyze the personal privacy and security concerns that arise with any use of computational systems.

[**Lesson 6: The Cost of Free**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/6/):
* Explain how and why personal data is exchanged for use of free software.
* Explain some of the privacy and economic tradeoffs involved in the collection and use of personal data.
* Describe the ways and reasons organizations collect information about individuals.
* Read and critically evaluate a data privacy policy.

[**Lesson 7: Simple Encryption**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/7/):
* Explain why encryption is an important need for everyday life on the Internet.
* Crack a message encrypted with a Caesar cipher using a Caesar Cipher Widget
* Crack a message encrypted with random substitution using Frequency Analysis
* Explain the weaknesses and security flaws of substitution ciphers

[**Lesson 8: Encryption with Keys and Passwords**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/8/):
* Explain the relationship between cryptographic keys and passwords.
* Explain in broad terms what makes a key difficult to “crack.”
* Reason about strong vs. weak passwords using a tool that shows password strength.
* Understand that exponential growth is related to an encryption algorithm’s strength.
* Explain how and why the Vigenère cipher is a stronger form of encryption than plain substitution.
* Explain properties that make for a good key when using the Vigenère Cipher.

[**Lesson : Public Key Cryptography**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/9/):
* Explain what the *modulo* operation does and how it operates as a "one-way" function
* Follow an asymmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt a numerical message using the Public Key Crypto widget.
* Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
* Describe the basic process of encrypting data using public key encryption
* Explain the benefits of public key cryptography

[**Lesson : Rapid Research - Cybercrime**](https://curriculum.code.org/csp-19/unit4/10/):
* Explain the characteristics of a phishing attack
* Explain how a DDoS attack works
* Describe how one computer virus works
* Research and describe a cyber attack found in the news
* Reason about the threats posed by, and methods of recourse for, various types of cyber attacks
* Describe plausible storage, security, or privacy concerns for particular pieces of data
